● Social Robotics: A subfield of HRI, social robotics, focuses on the social and relational aspects of human-robot interaction. \[8\] This includes:

○ How people respond cognitively and emotionally to robots \[8\]

○ How people use interpersonal skills when interacting with robots \[8\]

○ How to design robots to facilitate successful interactions. \[8\]

● Interdisciplinarity: HRI draws on insights and principles from various disciplines, including psychology, communication, anthropology, philosophy, and ethics. \[9\] This makes HRI an inherently interdisciplinary field. \[9\]

● Communication: Communication in HRI can take several forms: \[4\]

○ Remote Interaction: Communication occurs when the human and robot are not in close proximity, often through teleoperation or supervisory control. \[10\] This can involve challenges such as bandwidth limitations, communication delays, and mismatches in frames of reference. \[11\]

○ Proximate Interaction: This involves communication when the human and robot are in close proximity, possibly including physical interaction. \[12\] This raises safety and trust concerns. \[13, 14\]

○ Social Interaction: Humans and robots interact as peers or companions, involving social, emotive, and cognitive aspects. \[12\] Anthropomorphism plays a significant role in these interactions. \[12, 15\]

Challenges in HRI

● Natural Language Interaction: Enabling natural communication through speech requires advanced technologies like speech recognition, language understanding, mixed-initiative interaction, and cognitive modeling. \[16\]

● Telepresence and Information Fusion: Providing humans with an operational presence through remote interaction requires new ways to fuse information from robot sensors. \[11\] Challenges include bandwidth limitations, communication delays, and mismatches between human expectations and robot behaviors. \[11\]

● Interactive Learning: The complexity of the real world necessitates robots that can learn and adapt. \[17\] Interactive learning involves humans and robots working together to improve robot abilities in perception, autonomy, and interaction. \[18\]

● Trust: Building human trust in robots is crucial for successful adoption and use. \[19\] This requires addressing discrepancies between human expectations and robot capabilities. \[19\]

● Modeling Human Behavior: Understanding and predicting human behavior is essential for designing effective HRI systems. This requires developing models of human reasoning, behavior, intention, and action. \[20-22\]

● Ethical Considerations: As robots become more integrated into society, it is vital to address the ethical implications of their use. \[23-26\] This includes concerns about robot autonomy, responsibility for robot actions, and the potential impact on human relationships and employment. \[24-26\]

Applications of HRI
